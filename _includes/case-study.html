    <p>When <a href="http://washingtonmonthly.com" target="_blank">Washington Monthly</a> was searching for a redesign and build of their online news site, they did as many organizations do, put out an RFP. As a matter of policy, we don't respond to RFPs (mainly because we think they're a waste of valuable time and resources).</p>
    <p>Instead of responding to WM's RFP, we put together a small research package that included a full project estimate and recommendations they could use on their next build regardless of whether or not they granted us the contract.</p>
    <p>Long story short, WM chose us to design and build a custom WP installation complete with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Over 44% increase in online readership since launch</li>
      <li>50k+ archival post import</li>
      <li>Customized data table auto-format and integration for their popular annual
	<a href="http://washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide" target="_blank">College Guide</a></li>
      <li>Support for 100s of users in a press ready contributor/editor workflow</li>
      <li>Complete redesign and styleguide to be used across all media</li>
      <li>Bounce rate decrease of over 9%</li>
      <li>Ongoing dedicated support and maintenance (we're loyal!)</li>
    </ul>
